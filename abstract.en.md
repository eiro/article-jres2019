First, I will ask the questions that I think will identify the various aspects of the problem:

*  What are the ecological impacts of the production of IT hardware and software?
*  What are the trends and orders of magnitude?
*  What culture have we developed around this production?
*  How is this culture intimately linked to the problems we face and the solutions that will eventually have to be accepted?
*  What resources should ideally be mobilised to deal with the emergence and adoption of these solutions?

Then, I will refer to the multiple stakeholders and the messages conveyed
around the ecology of digital technology. I will try to identify a common,
factual and usable core to build a strategy.

I will then look at the strategy itself by developing several areas of focus:

* our immediate responsibility both as a producer and provider of services and also architectures
* my conviction that the Higher Education and Research community, if the
  politicians give us the means, is more capable than any other of designing,
  developing and promoting the innovations necessary for "digital transition"
  that respects the specifications set for us by the ecological realities.

Finally, I will explain the need to make our managers aware of the necessary
cultural changes that will first have to be made within our departments.
